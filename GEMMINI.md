Gemini Agent Instructions: Blog Section DevelopmentHello, Gemini! Please help me develop a blog section for my web project.My project uses React and shadcn/ui. The goal is to add a blog feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing application's look and feel.Step 1: Understand Project Structure and ThemeBefore you begin coding, please analyze the existing project files to understand:The overall color palette and font choices.How routes are currently handled (e.g., using a router or a simple conditional rendering logic).The general structure of components (e.g., where shared layouts or components are located).The current shadcn/ui theme configuration. Please adhere to the base shadcn/ui theme and its defaults unless a clear conflict with the existing project's style is present.Step 2: Create Mock Blog DataFirst, create a simple mock data file (e.g., src/data/blogs.js or similar) that contains an array of JavaScript objects. Each object should represent a blog post and have the following properties:id: A unique identifier (e.g., a number or string).title: The title of the blog post.excerpt: A short summary or first few sentences of the post.author: The name of the author.date: The publication date.slug: A URL-friendly string (e.g., "how-to-use-shadcn").Please create at least 10 mock blog posts to ensure the pagination functionality can be tested.Step 3: Develop the "Latest Blogs" ComponentCreate a new component (e.g., LatestBlogs.jsx) that will be used to display the three most recent blog posts.This component should import the mock data from Step 2.It should render only the three most recent blog posts, sorted by date.Use shadcn/ui components like Card and Button to present the blog posts in an aesthetically pleasing and consistent manner.Add a call-to-action button, such as "View All Blogs," that links to the new blog page you will create in the next step.Step 4: Develop the Full Blog Page with PaginationCreate a new page component (e.g., BlogPage.jsx) that will serve as the main blog index.This page should be at the /blog route.It should display all blog posts from the mock data as a grid or list of cards.Implement pagination logic to handle a large number of posts. For instance, display 6 posts per page.Use shadcn/ui components for the blog cards and a Pagination component for navigation.Ensure the page layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.Step 5: Integrate Components and RoutesFinally, integrate the new components into the project's existing structure.Add the LatestBlogs component to the appropriate place on the homepage or an existing landing page.Add a new route for /blog that renders the BlogPage component you created in Step 4.Please ensure the final code is well-commented and easy to understand. Let me know if you need any clarification on the existing project structure before you get started!
